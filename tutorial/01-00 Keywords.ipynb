    "\n",
    "In TypeScript, certain words have predefined meanings and cannot be used for anything else. These reserved words, called **keywords**, are the foundation of the language's syntax, defining how programs are structured and how they behave. They provide specific instructions and ensure that code is predictable and follows a consistent set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "TypeScript provides different categories of reserved words for managing various aspects of a program. This tutorial will go through the keywords in this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Types and Annotaion with primative types\n",
    "- Declaring Variables with `let` and `const` to define storage for values in your program\n",
    "- Flow Control with `if`, `else`, `switch`, `case`, `default`, `for`, `while`, `do`, `break`, and `continue` to determine the sequence in which code executes\n",
    "- Error Handling with `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw` to allow you to gracefully handle unexpected issues\n",
    "- Functions with `function`"
