    "# Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "A **statement** in TypeScript is an instruction that performs an action. Statements are the building blocks of a program and are executed sequentially unless specified otherwise. Semicolons (`;`) are used to terminate statements. While optional in most cases due to Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI), it's good practice to use them consistently to avoid unintended behavior.\n",

    "## Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expression**: A piece of code that evaluates to a value. Expressions are self-contained and do not inherently establish anything new, though they may be used as part of larger constructs that do.\n",
    "- **Declaration**: A piece of code that introduces a new \"thing\" into the program. Declarations often include **expressions**, especially for initialization, but the **declaration** itself is not an **expression**.\n",
    "- **Code Block**: A grouping of statements enclosed in curly braces `{}`. It allows multiple statements to be treated as a single unit. Much like **declarations** use **expressions**, code blocks are a basic building block for more a advanced kinds of statements."
