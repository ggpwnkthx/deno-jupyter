    "# Variables\n",
    "Declaring a variable in TypeScript means creating a named storage location in memory to hold a value that your program can use and modify. When you declare a variable, you’re essentially telling the program:\n",
    "- What to Call It: You give the variable a name, like age or username, which allows you to refer to it throughout your code.\n",
    "- What Kind of Data It Will Hold: By specifying a type, such as number or string, you define what kind of data can be stored in the variable. This helps prevent errors by making sure you don’t accidentally assign an incompatible type of value to it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example:"

    "## Keywords\n",
    "Keywords are reserved words in TypeScript (and many other programming languages) that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names or identifiers. These words are built into the language to perform specific actions or control how the program behaves. Keywords are essential for defining the structure and behavior of your code. When declaring a variale, these are the keywords you can use:\n",
    "- `let`: Declares a variable that can be updated (mutable).\n",
    "- `const`: Declares a variable that cannot be updated (immutable).\n",
    "- `var`: An older keyword for declaring variables that in most cases should not be used."

    "\n",
    "Variables can have properties and methods. Properties are values that are associated with a variable, and methods are behaviors (or functions) that performed in the context of the variable. Knowing how to use these properties and methods allows you to manipulate data more effectively and make use of the tools that TypeScript provides."
