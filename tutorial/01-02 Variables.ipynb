    "# Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is like a labeled container in which you store data. Variables allow programs to hold information and reuse it throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a variable, you:\n",
    "- Give it a **name** so you can refer to it later.\n",
    "- Specify a **type** to define what kind of data it will hold.\n",
    "- Assign a **value**, which is the data stored inside the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "To declare variables in TypeScript, you use the keywords `let` or `const`:\n",
    "- `let`: Allows the variable to be reassigned later.\n",
    "- `const`: Makes the variable immutable (its value cannot be changed).\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note***: *You should know that `var` is also a keyword that exists for declaring variables, but don't use it. It has outdated rules that can cause bugs. It remains available to support legacy behavior from older JavaScript, but itâ€™s use is problematic in modern TypeScript.*"

    "A variable that is declared outside of any function or block is part of the global scope. This means they are accessible everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "1. Use `const` by default for variables whose values won't change.\n",
    "2. Use `let` only when you expect the variable's value to change.\n",
    "3. Avoid using `var`, as it does not have block scope and can lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "4. Minimize the scope of variables to where they are needed for better readability and maintainability.\n"
