    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a cornerstone of programming, enabling code reuse and organization. In TypeScript, a **function** is a **code block** that can take input values (called **parameters**).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main ways to define functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Named Functions\n",
    "2. Anonymous Functions (often assigned to variables)\n",
    "3. Arrow Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Named Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A named function is declared using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name. This style is traditional in JavaScript and TypeScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "function functionName(parameters: Type): ReturnType {\n",
    "  // code block\n",
    "}\n",
    "```"
