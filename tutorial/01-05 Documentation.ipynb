In TypeScript, documentation is typically added using **comments**. These comments are ignored by the TypeScript compiler but serve as valuable notes for developers reading or maintaining the code.\n",

    "\n",

    "   - Avoid vague comments like `// Calculate something`.\n",
    "   - Instead, write `// Calculate the area of a circle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Keep Comments Up-to-Date**:\n",
    "   - If the code changes, ensure that the comments are updated as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoid Over-Commenting**:\n",
    "   - Comments should explain *why* the code exists, not *what* it does (if the code is self-explanatory).\n",
    "   - For example, instead of writing `// Add 5 to x`, simply write clear code like `x += 5;`."
