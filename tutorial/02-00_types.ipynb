    "# Types\n",
    "Types in programming, especially in languages like TypeScript, are classifications that describe the kinds of values that variables can hold. They help ensure that a piece of code behaves in predictable ways by enforcing rules on what kinds of data can flow through the code.\n",
    "## Intent and Understanding\n",
    "Types make the code more understandable and explicit. By clearly indicating what kind of data is expected and what each function does, types act as a form of in-line documentation, reducing misunderstandings. This clarity benefits both individual developers and teams, as it creates a shared language and consistency throughout the codebase.\n",
    "## Error Prevention and Early Bug Detection\n",
    "Types help catch errors long before code is run in production. By specifying data types, you reduce the chance of common mistakes, like passing a `string` where a `number` is expected, which might otherwise lead to subtle bugs or even application crashes. This proactive error detection minimizes debugging time and helps ensure code behaves as intended.\n",
    "## Developer Quality of Life\n",
    "Types power advanced features in modern development environments (like VSCode), such as autocompletion, inline error checking, and refactoring tools. These features make coding faster and more enjoyable by offering real-time feedback, reducing the need to memorize function details, and highlighting potential issues as you type.\n",
    "## Maintainability\n",
    "Typed code is easier to refactor and extend over time. As projects grow or requirements change, the type system can indicate where adjustments are needed, helping developers avoid unintended consequences. This makes the code more adaptable and resilient to changes, ensuring it remains reliable and maintainable as it evolves."
