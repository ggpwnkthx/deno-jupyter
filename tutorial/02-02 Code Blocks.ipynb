    "The **scope** of a variable is the region in your code where the variable is defined and can be used. When working with nested blocks, it's important to understand three kinds of scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside any block or function are in the global scope. They are accessible from anywhere in the program.\n",
    "2. **Block Scope**: Variables declared inside a code block (`{}`) are only accessible within that block and its nested blocks.\n",
    "3. **Inner (Nested) Scope**: When one block is inside another, the inner block has access to variables from the outer block. However, the reverse is not trueâ€”variables declared in the inner block are not accessible in the outer block.\n"
