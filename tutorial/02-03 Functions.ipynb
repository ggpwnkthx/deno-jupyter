    "\n",
    "Functions are essential in programming as they allow you to encapsulate and reuse logic. We previously discussed code blocks, which group multiple statements together inside `{}` braces. Functions take this concept further by allowing us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assign the block to a variable\n",
    "- Provide input data (**parameters**)\n",
    "- Evaluate expressions inside the code block\n",
    "- **Return** dynamic output data based on the input data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Named Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the **function** keyword followed by a name to create a reusable reference (similar to a variable) that stores the code block as its value. This allows the function to be invoked using its name, just like referencing a variable. It essentially is a variable, but it's important to make a distinction due to a concept called **hoisting** that will be discussed at the end of this tutorial.\n",
