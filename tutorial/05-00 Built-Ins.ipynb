    "# Built-Ins\n",
    "\n",
    "Deno provides a collection of built-in objects and functions that are accessible globally, without requiring any import statements. These built-ins are designed to simplify common programming tasks, improve developer productivity, and take full advantage of Deno's features and TypeScript capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore these built-ins, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `console`: Used for logging and debugging.\n",
    "- `Deno`: A namespace providing access to Deno's APIs.\n",
    "- `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `clearTimeout`: Timer functions.\n",
    "- `fetch`: Used for making HTTP requests.\n",
    "- `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder`: Tools for encoding and decoding text.\n",
    "- `URL` and `URLSearchParams`: Tools for URL manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each subsequent notebook will focus on one or more of these built-ins, providing in-depth explanations and practical examples.\n"
